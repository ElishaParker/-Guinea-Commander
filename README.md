# 🐹 Guinea Commander

*A peaceful 16-bit-style top-down shooter where love conquers chaos.*

Guinea Commander is a pixel-art browser game built with a custom HTML5 / Vite engine.  
Feed wandering guineas with food pellets and pets to rescue them from chaos.  
Each rescued friend strengthens you — compassion is your weapon.
